# Members Only App.

This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Project’s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms)

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

The seed.yml file has some default users and posts than can be loaded:

```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

If you encounter any problems, let me know, I'll be more than happy to help.
